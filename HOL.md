### Exercise 1: Building and Publishing a Node.js Web Site using GIT ###

In the first exercise you will create a new web site from the Windows Azure portal, create a 'Hello World' Node.js application and finally publish it, taking advantage of the new GIT publishing feature provided by Windows Azure.

<a name="Ex1Task2" />
#### Task 2 - Creating a new Node.js Website ####
 
1. Create a new folder in a location that can be easily accessed.

1. Open your favorite text editor and copy the following code that will send the string *Hello World* to the browser. Save the file as **server.js** in the folder you have previously created.
 
	```Javascript
	var http = require('http');
	var port = process.env.port || 1337;
	http.createServer(function (req, res) {
					  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
					  res.end('Hello World\n');
	}).listen(port);
	```
 
1. Create a new text file and paste the following code. Save the file as **package.json** in the same folder.
 
	```Json
	{
	  "name": "HelloWorld",
	  "version": "0.0.1",
	  "description": "",
	  "main": "./server.js",
	  "engines": { "node": ">= 0.6.0" }
	}
	```

	>**Note:** The package.json file tells the Node.js package manager (npm) how your package is structured, and which are the module dependencies. As this application is very simple it does not require dependencies, but in more complex applications you will probably need to specify a "dependencies" property. When publishing applications with Git, the Windows Azure platform automatically installs all the dependencies declared in this file.
 
1. In the text editor create a new file and paste the following code. This configuration indicates that the **server.js** file is a Node.js application
that should be handled by the **iisnode** module.
 
	> **Note:** The [iisnode](https://github.com/tjanczuk/iisnode) project provides a native IIS 7.x module that allows hosting of node.js applications in IIS 7.x.

	```XML
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
	<configuration>
		<system.webServer>
			  <modules runAllManagedModulesForAllRequests="false" />

			  <!-- indicates that the server.js file is a node.js application 
				to be handled by the iisnode module -->
			  <handlers>
				<add name="iisnode" path="server.js" verb="*" modules="iisnode" />
			  </handlers>
			  <rewrite>
				<rules>
				  <clear />
				  <rule name="app" enabled="true" patternSyntax="ECMAScript" stopProcessing="true">
					<match url="server\.js.+" negate="true" />
					<conditions logicalGrouping="MatchAll" trackAllCaptures="false" />
					<action type="Rewrite" url="server.js" />
				  </rule>
				</rules>
			  </rewrite>
		</system.webServer>
	</configuration>
	```
 
1. Save the file as **web.config** in your web site folder.

<a name="Ex1Task3" />
#### Task 3 – Publishing the Node.js application using Git####

1. Go back to the portal. Open the site's **Dashboard** and copy the **Git Clone Url** value from the bottom of the page.

	![Git Clone Url](images/git-clone-url.png?raw=true)

	_Copying the Git Clone Url_

1. In order to publish your local files, open a **Terminal** console, change directories to your application folder and run the following commands.

	```Terminal
	git init
	git add .
	git commit -m "initial commit"
	```

	> **Note:** You can learn more about Git commands in http://git-scm.com/documentation.

1. To add the remote Windows Azure repository and push the files, run the following commands. Replace the _{Git Clone Url}_ placeholder with the value obtained from the portal.

	```Terminal
	git remote add azure {Git Clone Url}
	git push azure master
	```

1. Enter the deployment credentials when prompted.

	> **Note:** Deployment credentials are other than the **Microsoft Account** associated with your Windows Azure subscription and are valid for use with all Windows Azure web sites associated with your subscription. If you don't know your deployment credentials you can easily reset them using the management portal. Open the web site **Dashboard** page and click the **Reset deployment credentials** link. Provide a new password and click Ok.

	>_Resetting the deployment credentials_

1. Go to the site's **Dashboard** and click the **Site Url** link to ensure that the site is running. A _Hello Word_ message will be shown.

### Exercise 2: Building and Publishing a Node.js Web Site using the Command-Line Tools ###

In this exercise, you will learn how manage web sites using the Windows Azure Command-Line Tools for Mac and Linux.

> **Note:** These steps assume you have the Windows Azure Command-Line Tools for Mac and Linux installed.

1. Open a **Terminal** console and execute the following command to download your account's **publish settings** file. A new browser window will pop up. Log on using your **Microsoft Account** credentials associated with your Windows Azure subscription.
    
	```Terminal
	azure account download
	```

	Your publish settings will be downloaded to your browser's default download folder (usually ~/Downloads) and a new page with relevant information will be displayed.

	![Downloading the publish settings file](images/download-publishsettings.png?raw=true "Downloading the publish settings file")

	_Downloading the publish settings file_

1. Go back to the **Terminal** console and import the file downloaded in the previous step by running the following command, specifying the **publish settings** file location in the _{publish_settings_file}_ placeholder.

	```Terminal
	azure account import {publish_settings_file}
	```

1. Execute [Task 2 from Exercise 1](#Ex1Task2) to create a Node.js site, but placing the files in a different folder.

1. Go back to the **Terminal** console and change directories in order to go to the folder where you placed the files.

1. Run the following command to create the Windows Azure Web Site with **GIT publishing** feature enabled.

	```Terminal
	azure site create --git
	```

	Provide a site name when prompted, for example **nodejsappOSXcli**. Then select a region and proceed.

	![Creating a new Web Site and enabling GIT publishing](images/new-web-site-cli.png?raw=true "Creating a new Web Site and enabling GIT publishing")

	_Creating a new Web Site and enabling GIT publishing_

	> **Note:** By specifying **--git** when running the command **site create** you don't need to run additional commands to initialize the Git repository or add the git remote, since these two tasks will be done automatically by the Windows Azure Command-Line Tools.

1. Now you will add the application files to a Git repository and push them to the Windows Azure Web Site. To do this, go back to the command prompt and execute the following commands. When prompted provide your deployment credentials.

	```Terminal
	git add .
	git commit -m "initial commit"
	git push azure master
	```
	![Pushing the site files](images/push-site.png?raw=true "Pushing the site files")

	_Pushing the site files_

	> **Note:** Deployment credentials are other than the **Microsoft Account** associated with your Windows Azure subscription and are valid for use with all Windows Azure web sites associated with your subscription. If you don't know your deployment credentials you can easily reset them using the management portal. Open the web site **Dashboard** page and click the **Reset deployment credentials** link. Provide a new password and click Ok.
	>
	>![Resetting the deployment credentials](images/deployment-credentials.png?raw=true "Resetting the deployment credentials")
	>
	>_Resetting the deployment credentials_

1. Run the following command to open the published deployments for your site in Windows Azure portal.

	```Terminal
	azure site portal
	```

	In Windows Azure portal, select your site from the list and open the **Deployments** page of the site. Check out the latest deployment.

	![Site deployments](images/site-deployments.png?raw=true "Site deployments")

	_Site deployments_

1. Execute the following command to browse to the published web site and make sure it works.

	```Terminal
	azure site browse
	```

	![Web site working](images/website-working-cli.png?raw=true "Web site working")
